## In this folder we created a dashboard using PowerBI.

## Page 1:

There are two bar plots in this page that represent NAICS codes based on 2 and 3 digits, respectively. Based on our analysis, we determined: 

          * Based on 2 digits:                   

                       * According to the data, the majority of commodity codes belong to category **33** which is **Manufacturing**.

           * Based on 3 digits:                     
                              
                       * Most commodity codes are associated with category **423** which is **Merchant Wholesalers, Durable Goods**.
                              
                              
                              

In addition, we provided two pie charts that illustrate the data as a percentage of the whole.

On this page, we examine Fairlead_OnTime data and compare Late delivered and OnTime delivered orders based on: 
          
          * COMPANY_ID    
          
          * ITEM_ID    
          
          * VEND_ID

 Here, we investigated industrial sectors and added a **Decomposition Tree** to depict how suppliers and sub-suppliers are related.
